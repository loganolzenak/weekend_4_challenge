                Say hello to Smokey, he's my adopted cat you all have heard about. <br>
                The reason I picked Smokey is because he's MY first pet that I spent my <br>
                own money on. He's also changed me

                This is a picture of my soccer team. I've been playing with these group of boys <br>
                ever since 6th grade. We've traveled by cars and planes to multiple states <br>
                for tournaments and also college show case tournaments. When we weren't playing <br>
                games , we'd be at practice from 7-9 pm Mon-Fri. We were like a family.

                This picture is to represent my "outdoor life", growing up my Dad would take <br>
                my brother and I hunting, along with my uncle and grandfather. Besides hunting <br>
                we would go fishing at our cabin and ice fishing during the winter. When my Stepdad <br>
                came into my life he introduced me to ATV's and dirtbikes. We'd go riding up north in <br>
                DeerHaven, MN, or at a cabin we rented out in Wisconsin.

                 Besides traveling for soccer I also have traveled alot with my parents! <br>
                When I was 13 or 14 my Dad took my brother and I to Mexico for the first time ever. <br>
                My Step-mom has a time share at a resort down there, so i've been there a few times. <br>
                My Mom traveled with me everytime I went out of state for soccer so we've seen plenty of <br>
                states together but when we weren't traveling for soccer, we would go out to California to <br>
                visit her mom!
